Added support for two special posts: *pictures* and *links*.

The categorizer looks att the first line of each post. If it is a link the
post title links to the url found instead of to the post. If the categorizer
thinks the link is to a picture (very simple right now, just looks at the
extension), the pic is added to the post before the text.
