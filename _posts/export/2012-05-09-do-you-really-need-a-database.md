*Alt. title for this post: how to take "no sql" way too far*

For my next trick.. i will make mysql disappear!

Made some code to save all data in files instead. Just because. Uses less memory. And (is for now)
superfast.

The goal now is to make this the most lightweight blogging engine EVER! :D

And it's going to get faster soon. I plan implementing a cacheing feature like
[boost for drupal](http://drupal.org/project/boost).
