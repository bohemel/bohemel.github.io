I wanted to code something, fast and dirty. And a wanted a REALLY bare bone blog engine.

Some of the reasons:

 * I work with Drupal every day, I want to do something else when I come home.
 * Play around with some cool API:s (twitter, facebook, etc., more on this later)
 * Total control over output

Lola is the result. I will probably put up the code on github. But don't bother. It's ugly now and will probably stay ugly forever.
