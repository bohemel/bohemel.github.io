I have a plan.

I want this engine to be "smart". I want it to be able to render a post in different ways depending on the content.
Like Tumblr, but smarter.

Example:

 * If I only write a title it will be rendered as a short message (like a tweet or something, maybe some twitter integration even). 
 * If I write a title and content is just an URL. The whole post is just a link.
   In the blog listing, just the title, linking to the link given in content is shown.

Stuff like that!

We'll see...
